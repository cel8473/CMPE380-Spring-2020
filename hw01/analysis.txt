    I created test.c

I created a file called Larson_myinfo.txt and put
my name, major, anticipated grad date, and each of
the programming languages I know and how well I 
know them. I ran MatLab on the Linux machine, and
screenshotted the screen. I listed all the hidden 
files in my root directory and redirected the 
output using UNIX redirection to a file called 
hidden.txt and added stuff to .bashrc then copied
it into my hw01 directory and called it bashrc.txt
Tested git by creating and adding a file to a git
repository, then added my name, and major to the 
file with separate committs for each, deleted the
file and recovered it from git, using git checkout.
And listed the change log above. It took a bit of
time to do the git part of the lab since I was having
difficulty commiting and commenting so it took way too long.
Other than that everything went smoothly. Now I am 
going to put everything into a tarball.
Conclusion, read the comment step on the git example.
