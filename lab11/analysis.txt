The prelab for this assignment was a review of least square data
fitting and GSL implementation. Lab_a.c had us use the gsl functions
to create matrixes and vectors and to decomp and solve for a solution.

The in-lab portion of the lab had us use the dynamic array files from
lab3 to be used for the lab_b.c file. We had to update 3 lines of code
with proper parameters and change one part of the main function.

The assignment was create a program that produces more accurate results
from this real device's ouput. This was done by using the least squares 
solution framework using QR factorizations and GSL. We had to code in
get_opt_long code and properly create the matrixes and vectors to house
the data. The device had an initiatial error with max, min, average, and
medians and we needed to make a correction polynomial that minimized the
error levels. All three lines: ideal, corrected and original 
were plotted using a plot program and a png was created to show how much
better the corrected is than the original. I found that the 3rd order
polynomial did the best job at correcting the data, after trying 2nd-5th
order polynomials.
