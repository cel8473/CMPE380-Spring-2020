I arrived on the Qn value of 24 because the iterations for the float 
bisection. Changing the Qn value changes the error because Qn represents
the fraction number of bits in the Qn format. If I try a value of 32 for
Qn I get a warning because the left shift count is larger than the width
of the type. This happens because you are trying to shift farther than
you should which would "break" the number.

The best optimization is the O3 optimization level as shown above.
The Qn gets 100%+ faster when going from level 0 to 1 but then 
only gets slightly faster from 1 to 2 and 2 to 3. Float bisection
gets 100%+ faster from level 0 to 1 and actually gets slightly 
slower from 1 to 2 and then again gets 100%+ faster when going from 
2 to 3. 

The prelab had us look into the limitations of traditional floating
point calculations and how we can lose precision. And how we can lose
some precision when converting to and from fixed and float numbers.

The in-lab had us work with Qn division, multiplication, complex 
equations and look at the performance of Qn vs float. All of this was
pretty easy and straight forward. 

The assignment was not too difficult, it was a bit unclear on when to
change numbers from float to fix and vice versa. The TAs had to step
me through when to use the functions and what types are being printed.
